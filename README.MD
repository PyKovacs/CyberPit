# CyberPit

*IN CONSTRUCTION*<br>
... and probably will be for a long time.<br>
As this project is my python playground. Whenever I learn some new stuff I find useful, I try and implement it in CyberPit. I experiment here a lot, trying to focus on the SW design.<br>

Anyway - the game itself is a text-based game (like the old times) where you buy a battle robot and fight against opponent in the pit. You earn bitcoin for each won match. Once you can afford it, you can buy more powerful bots.
