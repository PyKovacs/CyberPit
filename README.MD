# CyberPit

*IN CONSTRUCTION*
... and probably will be for a long time.
As this project is my python playground. Whenever I learn some new stuff I find useful, I try and implement it in CyberPit. I experiment here a lot, trying to focus on the SW design.

Anyway - the game itself is a text-base game (like the old times) where you buy a battle robot and fight against opponent in the pit. You earn bitcoin for each won match. Once you can afford it, you can buy more powerful bots.
